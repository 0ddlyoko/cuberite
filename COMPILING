COMPILING
=========

To compile MCServer on *nix, you need CMake and make, as well as a C compiler, C++ compiler and linker.

Release Mode
------------

Release mode is preferred for almost all cases, it has much better speed and less console spam. However, if you are developing MCServer actively, debug mode might be better.

    cmake . && make
    
Debug Mode
----------

Debug mode is useful if you want more debugging information about MCServer as it's running or if you want to use a debugger like GDB to debug issues and crashes.

    cmake . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG && make
